# Semantic Code Refactor

## Description

Given starter code, the goal was to modify the code to make it follow accessibility standards so it's optimized for search engines and it ensures that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to the website.

The code was also modified for long term sustainability by replacing existing elements with semantic elements, adding comments to sections and/or elements, ensuring link functionality, organizing and consolidating the CSS to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.
